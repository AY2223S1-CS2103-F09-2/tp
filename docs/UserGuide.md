**Duke The Market** is a one-stop marketing tool that allows department stores to keep track of their upcoming
marketing plan roll-outs, monitor its impact, and to target the appropriate subsegment of its customer base for each of those plans.
Also, it is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User
Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Duke The Market can help you organise your marketing events and reach out to your target customer base much faster than a traditional GUI app.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

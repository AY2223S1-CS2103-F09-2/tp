### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `EventListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` objects and `Event` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` and `Events` objects (which are contained in the `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueEventList` objects).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Event` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Sort Persons

The sort persons feature allows the user to sort persons by their name, date of birth or gender.

The field to sort persons by is encapsulated within the `PersonSortField` class. `PersonSortField` stores the sort field enumeration (`PersonSortFieldType`) as well as the `Comparator` object that defines the sorting logic.

The following class diagram shows how the `PersonSortField` class integrates with the other components:

![PersonSortFieldClassDiagram](images/PersonSortFieldClassDiagram.png)
<br><br>

Sorting is performed as part of `listPersonsCommand#execute()`. The sorting operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#sortPersons()` which calls `AddressBook#sortPersons()` which in turn calls `UniquePersonList#sort()` to sort the underlying `ObservableList<Person>`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the relevant sorting method calls for the command `listPersons s/n` with a `PersonSortField` object `s`:

![SortPersonsSequenceDiagram](images/SortPersonsSequenceDiagram.png)



<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Sorting is performed directly on the underlying `UniquePersonList` object, which means the sorted result is **permanent**. For example, if `listPersons s/n` and `listPersons` are executed back-to-back, the result of the second `listPersons` command will display the sorted results from the first `listPersons s/n` command because the sorted result is permanent.
</div>


#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: How sorting is performed:**

Ideally, sorting should be a "view" level operation that doesn't change the underlying person list. However, the way the UI is designed makes it difficult to implement sorting as such. The issue is that the UI is **hardcoded** to only display persons from the `UniquePersonList` object. As such, any changes to the person list must be made directly to the `UniquePersonList` object. i.e. A modified copy of the person list cannot be passed to the UI during runtime since the UI is hardcoded to show only the `UniquePersonList` object.

Therefore, given the constraints of the UI, sorting is implemented as a **permanent operation**.


* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort the underlying person list directly.
  * Pros: User can directly use the index numbers of the sorted list to interact with the persons using other commands such as `editPerson` or `deletePerson`.
  * Cons: Sorted result is permanent, instead of being a "view" level operation.

* **Alternative 2:** Sort the person list at the UI level.
   * Pros: Sorted result is not permanent. So sorting won't interfere with the underlying person list.
   * Cons: Requires redesigning a significant part of the `UI`, `Logic` and `Model` classes.

### Adding Events

The Add Event feature that is accessed through the `addEvent` command allows users to add new marketing campaigns of
the `event` class to the application.

The `event` added by the user will have 4 compulsory fields:
- Title of the `event`
- Date of the `event`
- Time of the `event`
- Purpose of the `event`

The `addEvent` operation is facilitated by `AddEventCommand` which extends from `Command`. If the users' input matches
the `COMMAND_WORD` of `AddEventCommand` in `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, `AddEventCommandParser#parse()` will
process the additional user inputs which constitute the 4 compulsory fields of the `event` class and return an
`AddEventCommand`.

Executing this Command object through the `AddEventCommand#execute()` triggers the `Model` interface's
`Model#addEvent()`. This operation subsequently calls upon the `AddressBook#addEvent()` operation which in turn calls
upon the `UniqueEventList#add()` operation and the `event` will be stored in memory.

The addEvent operation will also trigger the `StorageManager#saveAddressBook()` operation which will save the event to
a .JSON format together with all other `Person`(s) and `Event`(s) in memory.

The following sequence diagram will illustrate how the `addEvent` operation works:

![AddEventSequenceDiagram](images/AddEventSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** `cmd` in the diagram represents the add
event command text entered by user. event represents the event class created and stored within AddEventCommand.
Additionally, saving of the updated events list has been excluded from this diagram for simplicity.
</div>


### Deleting Events

The Delete Event feature that is accessed through the `deleteEvent` command allows users to delete marketing campaigns of
the `event` class in the application.

The `deleteEvent` operation is facilitated by `DeleteEventCommand` which extends from `Command`. If the users' input matches
the `COMMAND_WORD` of `DeleteEventCommand` in `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, `DeleteEventCommandParser#parse()` will
process the additional user input which is the current index of the marketing event on the User Interface.

Executing this Command object through the `DeleteEventCommand#execute()` triggers the `Model` interface's
`Model#deleteEvent()`. This operation subsequently calls upon the `AddressBook#deleteEvent()` operation which in turn calls
upon the `UniqueEventList#remove()` operation and the `event` will be removed from memory.

The deleteEvent operation will also trigger the `StorageManager#saveAddressBook()` operation which will save the current
list of events which excludes the deleted event to a .JSON format together with all other `Person`(s) in memory.

The following sequence diagram will illustrate how the `deleteEvent` operation works:

![DeleteEventSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteEventSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** `cmd` in the diagram represents the delete
event command text entered by user. event represents the instance of event class created and stored within DeleteEventCommand.
Additionally, saving of the updated events list from has been excluded from this diagram for simplicity.
</div>

### Add Gender

The Add Gender feature allows users to add a gender field (Male / Female) to a person in the contact list. It is performed as a part
 of `addPersonCommand#execute()`.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as the method `Model#addPerson()`, which calls
`AddressBook#addPerson()` which calls `UniquePersonList#add()` to add a new person in the person list
stored in AddressBook.

The following sequence diagram shows the methods calls related to add person operation:

![AddPersonSequenceDiagram](images/AddPersonSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** `cmd` in the diagram represents the add
person command text entered by user. The specific `UniquePersonList` operations are not shown in the diagram
for simplicity.
</div>

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes a new add command:

![AddPersonActivityDiagram](images/AddPersonActivityDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Only the
activities related to gender field are considered and shown in this activity diagram.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**Parser exceptions are thrown and caught if
gender field is not provided in the command, or the gender is not of valid format; Duplicated person exception is
thrown if the person to add already exists in the contact list. Error message is displayed on the GUI subsequently.
</div>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Whether gender field should be optional for a person:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Compulsory gender field:
    * Pros: It is a more logical implementation because gender is a common attribute for all persons,
  similar to name, address, etc, which are also compulsory field for persons in contact list.
    * Cons: It is less flexible, since only female and male genders are accepted.

* **Alternative 2:** Optional gender field:
    * Pros: It is a more flexible implementation, since user has the choice to set gender to male or female,
  as well as hide gender.
    * Cons: It is less logical since gender is usually a required binary field in most applications.

### Edit Gender

The Edit Gender feature allows users to edit a gender field (Male / Female) of a person in the contact list.
It is performed as a part of `editPersonCommand#execute()`.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as the method `Model#setPerson()`, which calls
`AddressBook#setPerson()` which calls `UniquePersonList#setPerson()` to replace an existing person with a new person
object with edited fields in the person list stored in AddressBook.

The following sequence diagram shows the methods calls related to edit person operation:

![EditPersonSequenceDiagram](images/EditPersonSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** `cmd` in the diagram represents the edit
person command text entered by user; the `setPerson(P1, P2)` method replaces person P1 with person P2 in the person list
in the model. The specific `UniquePersonList` operations are not shown in the diagram for simplicity.
</div>

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes a new edit command:

![EditPersonActivityDiagram](images/EditPersonActivityDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Only the
activities related to gender field are considered and shown in this activity diagram. All fields are considered optional
in edit person command, therefore, it is not compulsory that gender field must be provided.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**Parser exceptions are thrown and caught if
the gender is not of valid format; Invalid person exception is thrown if the person to edit doesn't exist in the
contact list. Error message is displayed on the GUI subsequently.
</div>

### Add Date Of Birth

The Add Date Of Birth feature allows users to add a date of birth field (format: dd/mm/yyyy) to a person in the addressbook. It is performed as a part of `addPersonCommand#execute()`.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as the method `Model#addPerson()`, which calls
`AddressBook#addPerson()` which calls `UniquePersonList#add()` to add a new person in the person list
stored in AddressBook.

The following sequence diagram shows the methods calls related to add person operation:

![AddPersonSequenceDiagram](images/AddPersonSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** `cmd` in the diagram represents the add
person command text entered by user. The specific `UniquePersonList` operations are not shown in the diagram
for simplicity.
</div>

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes a new add person command:

![AddPersonActivityDiagram](images/AddPersonActivityDiagram_DOB.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Only the
activities related to date of birth field are considered and shown in this activity diagram.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**Parser exceptions are thrown and caught if
date of birth field is not provided in the command, or the date of birth is not of valid format; Duplicate person exception is
thrown if the person to add already exists in the addressbook. Error message is displayed on the GUI subsequently.
</div>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Whether date of birth field should be optional for a person:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Compulsory date of birth field:
    * Pros: It is a more logical implementation because date of birth is a common attribute for all persons,
  similar to name, address, etc, which are also compulsory fields for persons in the addressbook.
    * Cons: It is less flexible in cases where the user is missing the date of birth field for a contact,
    but wants to add the contact anyways, as the user is not able to leave the date of birth field blank.

* **Alternative 2:** Optional date of birth field:
    * Pros: It is a more flexible implementation, since the user has the choice to set a date of birth,
    or leave it empty.
    * Cons: It is less logical since date of birth is a common attribute for all persons in the addressbook.

### Edit Date of Birth

The Edit Date of Birth feature allows users to edit a date of birth field (format: dd/mm/yyyy) of a person in the addressbook.
It is performed as a part of `editPersonCommand#execute()`.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as the method `Model#setPerson()`, which calls
`AddressBook#setPerson()` which calls `UniquePersonList#setPerson()` to replace an existing person with a new person
object with edited fields in the person list stored in AddressBook.

The following sequence diagram shows the methods calls related to edit person operation:

![EditPersonSequenceDiagram](images/EditPersonSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** `cmd` in the diagram represents the edit
person command text entered by user; the `setPerson(P1, P2)` method replaces person P1 with person P2 in the person list
in the model. The specific `UniquePersonList` operations are not shown in the diagram for simplicity.
</div>

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes a new edit command:

![EditPersonActivityDiagram](images/EditPersonActivityDiagram_DOB.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Only the
activities related to date of birth field are considered and shown in this activity diagram. The edit person command only requires at least one of the optional fields to be given, all of the fields are optional, therefore, it is not compulsory that a date of birth field must be provided.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**Parser exceptions are thrown and caught if
the date of birth is not of valid format; Invalid person exception is thrown if the person to edit doesn't exist in the
addressbook. Error message is displayed on the GUI subsequently.
</div>

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature
#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_


### Listing Events

The List Events feature allows users to enter `listEvents` and update the UI display for events, showing a list of all
events sorted in their current order inside `ModelManager`. In the future, the command will take in a parameter,
which specifies the field that the events list can be permanently sorted by.

The List Events feature is facilitated by `ListEventsCommand` which extends from `Command`. Additionally, it implements
the following operation:

* `ModelManager#updateFilteredEventList()` â€‰â€”â€‰Updates the predicate inside `ModelManager`'s filtered event list
to modify and sort which and how events are shown.

This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as the method `Model#updateFilteredEventList()`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `listEvents` operation works.

![ListEventsSequenceDiagram](images/ListEventsSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Only the activities related to events are
considered and shown in this activity diagram.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ListEventsCommand` should
end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.
</div>

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: If `listEvents` should sort events permanently:**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort all events permanently.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: Whenever events are added, they are always added as the last event in the event list. Once sorted, the order
  cannot be returned to the order which events were added.
* **Alternative 2:** Sort all events temporarily.
  * Pros: When users sort their events, the ordering of the events in `ModelManager` stays constant.
  * Cons: Hard to implement as a new form of storage or memory has to be created to maintain the relative ordering of
    events.

## **Appendix: Effort**

Our group felt that the project was slightly difficult. Although our group has put in extensive effort into the planning of the project,
we still encountered numerous merge conflicts and situations that we did not expect (needing to change how we implement the storage of certain
entities). Compared to other groups, we believe that we have put in an average amount of effort because one of the past lectures mentioned how
most groups had over-exceeded the amount of effort that is actually required.

Fortunately, some members within the group were able to experience first-hand working with others on a serious Software Engineering project. For
those that were more experienced, we still had new takeways when we worked with other members in the group and we were able to guide each other
and receive proper feedback from other groups in class as well as hold respectful discussions within the group. We believe our product has
some use in the real world as it is simple enough to be used and can even be extended to other uses.

Additionally, our group gained more experience when it came to manual and automated testing. We were better able to learn a more complex test suite
offered by AB3 and adapted it for own use.

Compared to AB3 which deals with only one entity type (Person), our group dealt with two entity types (Person and Event). Though some of the fields
were similar in implementation, our group had struggled slightly with learning how to tag multiple person(s) to one event as each suggestion that
every team member came up with had its pros and flaws.
